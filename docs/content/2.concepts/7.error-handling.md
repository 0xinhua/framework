# Error handling

Nuxt 3 is a full-stack framework, which mean there are several sources of unpreventable user runtime errors that can happen in different contexts:

1. Errors during the Vue rendering lifecycle (SSR + SPA)
1. Errors during API or Nitro server lifecycle
1. Server and client startup errors (SSR + SPA)

## Errors during the Vue rendering lifecycle (SSR + SPA)

You can hook into Vue errors using [`onErrorCaptured`](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-lifecycle.html#onerrorcaptured).

In addition, Nuxt provides a `vue:error` hook that will be called if there are any errors that propagate up to the top level. Returning false to this hook will stop the error from propagating further.

## Server and client startup errors (SSR + SPA)

Nuxt provides an `app:error` hook that will be called if there are any errors in starting your Nuxt application. This includes:

* running Nuxt plugins
* processing `app:created` and `app:beforeMount` hooks
* mounting the app (on client-side), though you should handle this case with `onErrorCaptured` or with `vue:error`
* processing the `app:mounted` hook
